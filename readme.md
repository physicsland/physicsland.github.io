# [Physics.Land](https://www.physics.land)  

## The is the hidden dimension to the full scale transformative Physics Land project (launched 2019).   

The resource is built with Angular web app, as a Google Firebase Project, on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Our goal is to add all freshmen physics topics on there, and beyond. From simple basic calculations for all physis 101 questions, to the full range computations with error propagation, 3-D virtual reality visualization (of vectors, cross products, E&M, Torque, etc), complex-valued computations and more.

Come back from time to time and see the new additions we are putting in place. Hope you'll like it and find it useful.
